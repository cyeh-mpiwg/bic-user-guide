BIC is designed for researchers interested in the history of books in China. With BIC, a researcher can explore the geographic distribution of particular titles in user-defined time periods, research people associated with book authorship and acquisition, how the types of books in schools changed over time, the history of editions, etc. BIC incorporates information on over 30,000 books, most of which were located in local schools. For each book there is a \u201cStorage Record\u201d consisting of associated time and location information, which makes possible chronological visualizations and spatial mapping. Additional information, such as the manner of acquisition, number of volumes, author, format, and publisher, is included when available in the original source. BIC also has a \u201cNotes\u201d field that contain Joseph Dennis\u2019 research notes. These notes provide his rationale for book date estimates and other information on the books.

From the homepage, a user can directly search a book title using Basic Book Title Search or open the Advanced Search or Browse Titles pages to begin.

A: Some books currently have category information in the \u201cDescription\u201d or \"Notes\" fields, but most do not. The categories of those that do were taken from book lists that separated books by category or were taken from WCAT when researching the dating.

Suppose you wanted to research different editions of the Shiji \u53f2\u8a18 (The Grand Scribe\u2019s Records). You could start by adding a book title filter in Advanced Search and then typing \u53f2\u8a18. Then use the Book Info button to restrict the display to \u201cvolumes,\u201d as in the image below, to identify various configurations in which it was published. Although most school library book list entries do not contain explicit edition information, they often record the physical configuration, which is a clue to the edition. For example, the Shiji results in the data table contain versions in two, seven, eight, ten, thirteen, sixteen, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-eight, thirty, thirty-six, and forty volumes (ben \u672c or \u518c), and 130 chapters (juan \u5377). Some records also list the number of boxes, e.g., one lists the Shiji as being 130 chapters in four boxes containing thirty-two volumes ( yibaisanshi juan si han sanshier ben \u4e00\u767e\u4e09\u5341\u5377\u56db\u51fd\u4e09\u5341\u4e8c\u672c).

Repeat this process to add other configurations, then click on the \u201cCollect and Compare\u201d button. To make the comparison easier to read, add labels.

If you wanted to examine the history of Jiaon\u00fc yigui in one province, you could click on a province name in the Summary panel.
